It uses the Llama-Guard library for content safety checks and the AuditNLG library for sensitive topic checks. The model is trained on a dataset of text prompts and corresponding safe and unsafe responses. The code includes functions for handling safety checks, generating text, and running the model in inference mode.<details> |

The code includes the following features:

* Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer
* Define a function `main` that takes various parameters such as the model name, prompt file, and safety parameters
* Perform safety checks on the user prompt and the generated text using various methods
* Generate text using the model and tokenizer, with options to control the length and diversity of the generated text
* Print the generated text and any safety results or warnings<details> |

The model takes in a prompt and generates text based on the input, with options for controlling the length of the generated text and the probability of certain tokens being included. The code also includes a safety check of the user prompt and the model output to ensure they are safe and do not contain sensitive or inappropriate content.<details> |
